# keep_grinding

## Intro

A Flutter project that gamifies life by awarding points for completing real-life tasks you've set for yourself. With the points earned, you can reward yourself by purchasing items or allowing yourself to do certain activities.

Excpected Behavior:
- User Create one (or more) ToDo on the app (with n point reward) like "Send Mail to Mark" or "Do some sport"
- User complete the task in real life and the check the task's box on the app => Gain n point
- User can allow himself to buy/do something like "a shot of vodka at 8 a.m." with theses n points

## Why using that ?

This is an app to **combat procrastination** by focusing on rewards rather than deadline pressure, (inspired by The Good Place, where rewards are eventually forgotten, and then people do what they need automatically).
It also helps **curb impulsive buying** by limiting purchases to points earned through completing a to-do list.
